1. Introduction
===============

The files in this directory provide the FASTA format sequences for a
genome assembly in a package convenient for use by various Next
Generation Sequence read alignment pipelines. The sequence names,
sequence order, and format of the sequence definition lines, were
developed in consultation with several developers and major users of
alignment pipelines. 

Index files generated by BWA, Samtools, Bowtie and HISAT2 are also 
provided.

The full_analysis_set contains the sequences, in FASTA format, of 
the chromosomes, mitochondrial genome, unlocalized scaffolds, and 
unplaced scaffolds. The definition line has a UCSC-style sequence 
identifier and contains metadata in a series of space-separated 
tag-value pairs. 


2. File names and contents
==========================

FASTA files
-----------
GCA_000001635.9_GRCm39_full_analysis_set.fna.gz

A gzipped file that contains FASTA format sequences for the following:
1. chromosomes from the GRCm39 Primary Assembly unit (C57BL/6J).
2. mitochondrial genome from the GRCm39 non-nuclear assembly unit.
3. unlocalized scaffolds from the GRCm39 Primary Assembly unit 
   (C57BL/6J).
4. unplaced scaffolds from the GRCm39 Primary Assembly unit 
   (C57BL/6J).

Note for Picard tool users:
Older versions of Picard tools do not support the .fna extension for
FASTA sequence files. To use the analysis_set.fna files provided in 
this directory either upgrade to a newer version of Picard tools 
(version 1.130 or higher) or rename the files to .fa.

BWA index files
---------------
GCA_000001635.9_GRCm39_full_analysis_set.fna.bwa_index.tar.gz

tar archives containing BWA index files for the analysis sets. The BWA
index files were generated by running bwa version 0.7.17 using the 
default parameters for the index command.

Samtools index files
--------------------
GCA_000001635.9_GRCm39_full_analysis_set.fna.fai

The Samtools index files were generated by running Samtools version 
1.9 using the default parameters for the index command.

Bowtie2 index files
-------------------
GCA_000001635.9_GRCm39_full_analysis_set.fna.bowtie_index.tar.gz

tar archives containing Bowtie2 index files for the analysis sets. The 
Bowtie2 index files were generated by running Bowtie2 version 2.2.6 
using the default parameters for the index command.

HISAT2 index files
------------------
GCA_000001635.9_GRCm39_full_analysis_set.fna.hisat2_index.tar.gz

tar archives containing HISAT2 index files for the analysis sets. The 
HISAT2 index files were generated by running HISAT2 version 2.0.5 
using the default parameters for the index command.

Annotation files
----------------
GCA_000001635.9_GRCm39_full_analysis_set.refseq_annotation.gff.gz
GCA_000001635.9_GRCm39_full_analysis_set.refseq_annotation.gtf.gz

Gzipped RefSeq annotation files in GFF3 and GTF format with column 1
seq-ids adjusted to use the UCSC-style names to match the FASTA files.

3. Sequence names
=================

The sequence names in the analysis sets use UCSC names when these have
already been assigned or otherwise follow the following UCSC-style 
naming patterns.

Chromosomes:
chr{chromosome number or name}
e.g. chr1 or chrX
chrM for the mitochondrial genome.

Unlocalized scaffolds:
chr{chromosome number or name}_{sequence_accession}v{sequence_version}_random
e.g. chr17_GL000205v2_random

Unplaced scaffolds:
chrUn_{sequence_accession}v{sequence_version}
e.g. chrUn_GL000220v1


4. Metadata tag-value pairs
===========================

The FASTA definition lines contain sequences metadata in a series of
space-separated tag-value pairs.

Tag Value
--- -----
AC: sequence accession.version
gi: sequence gi
LN: sequence length
rg: region
    - chromosome to which unlocalized scaffolds are assigned,
       e.g. chr1
    - region on chromosome within which alt-scaffolds or patch 
      scaffolds are placed, e.g. chr6:28696604-33335493
    - not present for chromosomes, other replicons, or unplaced 
      scaffolds
    - coordinates are 1-based 
rl: role of the sequence in the assembly
    - possible values are: Chromosome, Mitochondrion, unlocalized, 
      unplaced, alt-scaffold fix-patch, novel-patch, decoy
M5: md5 checksum of the sequence as a single string of uppercase 
    letters without line breaks (as produced by Samtools or Picard)
AS: assembly-name
hm: hard-masked regions, either a single span, two spans separated by
    a comma, or "multiple" if more than two spans were hard-masked
    - coordinates are 1-based
tp: topology
    - circular for chrM and chrEBV
    - not present for linear chromosomes and scaffolds


5. Definitions
==============

Unlocalized sequence:
A sequence found in an assembly that is associated with a specific 
chromosome but cannot be ordered or oriented on that chromosome. 

Unplaced sequence:
A sequence found in an assembly that is not associated with any 
chromosome.  

Alt-scaffold:
A scaffold that provides an alternate representation of a locus found
in the primary assembly. These sequences do not represent a complete
chromosome sequence. Although there is no hard limit on the size of 
the alternate locus, currently these are less than 1 Mb.

Major release:
The formal release of a genome assembly, e.g. GRCm39.

Minor release:
A release of a genome assembly including patches that occurs between
major releases.

Genome Patch:
A sequence contig/scaffold that corrects sequence in a major release
of the genome, or adds sequence to it.

Fix-patch:
A patch that corrects sequence or reduces an assembly gap in a given
major release. FIX patch sequences are meant to be incorporated into
the primary or existing alt-loci assembly units at the next major
release.

Novel-patch:
A patch that adds sequence to a major release. Typically, NOVEL patch
sequences are meant to be incorporated into the assembly as new
alternate loci at the next major release.

Decoy:
A sequence that is not part of the genome assembly but is included in
an analysis set as a sink for alignment of reads that are often
present in sequencing samples.
