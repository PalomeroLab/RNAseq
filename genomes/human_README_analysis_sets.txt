1. Introduction
===============

The files in this directory provide the FASTA format sequences for a
genome assembly in a package convenient for use by various Next
Generation Sequence read alignment pipelines. The sequence names,
sequence order, and format of the sequence definition lines, were
developed in consultation with several developers and major users of
alignment pipelines. 

Index files generated by BWA, Samtools, Bowtie and HISAT2 are also 
provided.

The no_alt_analysis_set contains the sequences, in FASTA format, of 
the chromosomes, mitochondrial genome, unlocalized scaffolds, and 
unplaced scaffolds. The alternate locus scaffolds are omitted because
many Next Generation Sequence read alignment pipelines are 
incompatible with the full assembly model. The two PAR regions on 
chromosome Y, and duplicate copies of centromeric arrays and WGS on 
chromosomes 5, 14, 19, 21 & 22, have been hard-masked with Ns for the
same reason. The sequences for chromosomes 5, 14, 19, 21, 22 & Y 
therefore differ from the INSDC sequences, although the coordinates 
are preserved. An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) sequence is included in the
analysis set, even though it is not part of the genome assembly, to 
act as a sink for alignment of reads that are often present in 
sequencing samples. The definition line has a UCSC-style sequence 
identifier and contains metadata in a series of space-separated 
tag-value pairs. 

The full_analysis_set contains the alternate locus scaffolds in 
addition to all the sequences present in the no_alt_analysis_set.

The full_plus_hs38d1_analysis_set contains the human decoy sequences
from hs38d1 (GCA_000786075.2) in addition to all the sequences present
in the full_analysis set.

The no_alt_plus_hs38d1_analysis_set contains the human decoy sequences
from hs38d1 (GCA_000786075.2) in addition to all the sequences present
in the no_alt_analysis set.

RefSeq annotation for this assembly is provided in GFF3 and GTF formats that 
have been remapped to use the same set of UCSC-style sequence 
identifiers used in the FASTA files. Providing sequence and annotation
files with matching sequence identifiers supports their use in 
commonly used RNA-Seq analysis packages.


2. File names and contents
==========================

FASTA files
-----------
A. GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz

A gzipped file that contains FASTA format sequences for the following:
1. chromosomes from the GRCh38 Primary Assembly unit.
   Note: the two PAR regions on chrY have been hard-masked with Ns. 
   The chromosome Y sequence provided therefore has the same 
   coordinates as the GenBank sequence but it is not identical to the
   GenBank sequence. Similarly, duplicate copies of centromeric arrays
   and WGS on chromosomes 5, 14, 19, 21 & 22 have been hard-masked 
   with Ns (locations of the unmasked copies are given below). 
2. mitochondrial genome from the GRCh38 non-nuclear assembly unit.
3. unlocalized scaffolds from the GRCh38 Primary Assembly unit.
4. unplaced scaffolds from the GRCh38 Primary Assembly unit.
5. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) sequence 
   Note: The EBV sequence is not part of the genome assembly but is 
   included in the analysis set as a sink for alignment of reads that
   are often present in sequencing samples. 

B. GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_full_analysis_set.fna.gz

A gzipped file that contains all the same FASTA formatted sequences as
GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz, plus:
6. alt-scaffolds from the GRCh38 ALT_REF_LOCI_* assembly units.

C. GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_full_plus_hs38d1_analysis_set.fna.gz

A gzipped file that contains all the same FASTA formatted sequences as
GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_full_analysis_set.fna.gz, plus:
7.  human decoy sequences from hs38d1 (GCA_000786075.2)

D. GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_plus_hs38d1_analysis_set.fna.gz

Note for Picard tool users:
Older versions of Picard tools do not support the .fna extension for
FASTA sequence files. To use the analysis_set.fna files provided in 
this directory either upgrade to a newer version of Picard tools 
(version 1.130 or higher) or rename the files to .fa.

3. Sequence names
=================

The sequence names in the analysis sets use UCSC names when these have
already been assigned or otherwise follow the following UCSC-style 
naming patterns.

Chromosomes:
chr{chromosome number or name}
e.g. chr1 or chrX
chrM for the mitochondrial genome.

Unlocalized scaffolds:
chr{chromosome number or name}_{sequence_accession}v{sequence_version}_random
e.g. chr17_GL000205v2_random

Unplaced scaffolds:
chrUn_{sequence_accession}v{sequence_version}
e.g. chrUn_GL000220v1

Alternate loci scaffolds:
chr{chromosome number or name}_{sequence_accession}v{sequence_version}_alt
e.g. chr6_GL000250v2_alt

Patch scaffolds:
chr{chromosome number or name}_{sequence_accession}v{sequence_version}_patch
e.g. chrY_KN196487v1_patch 

Decoy sequences:
chrUn_{sequence_accession}v{sequence_version}_decoy
e.g. chrUn_KN707606v1_decoy


4. Metadata tag-value pairs
===========================

The FASTA definition lines contain sequences metadata in a series of
space-separated tag-value pairs.

Tag Value
--- -----
AC: sequence accession.version
gi: sequence gi
LN: sequence length
rg: region
    - chromosome to which unlocalized scaffolds are assigned,
       e.g. chr1
    - region on chromosome within which alt-scaffolds or patch 
      scaffolds are placed, e.g. chr6:28696604-33335493
    - not present for chromosomes, other replicons, or unplaced 
      scaffolds
    - coordinates are 1-based 
rl: role of the sequence in the assembly
    - possible values are: Chromosome, Mitochondrion, unlocalized, 
      unplaced, alt-scaffold fix-patch, novel-patch, decoy
M5: md5 checksum of the sequence as a single string of uppercase 
    letters without line breaks (as produced by Samtools or Picard)
AS: assembly-name
hm: hard-masked regions, either a single span, two spans separated by
    a comma, or "multiple" if more than two spans were hard-masked
    - coordinates are 1-based
tp: topology
    - circular for chrM and chrEBV
    - not present for linear chromosomes and scaffolds


5. Unmasked copies of centromeric arrays, WGS and PAR
=====================================================

The file unmasked_cognates_of_masked_CEN_PAR.txt gives the locations
of the unmasked cognate of those centromeric arrays and WGS on 
chromosomes 5, 14, 19, 21 & 22 that were hard-masked with Ns because
they are exact duplicates. This file also gives the locations of the
PAR regions on chromosome X that correspond to the PAR regions on
chromosome Y that were hard-masked. Sequence reads will align to 
these unmasked copies of the PAR, centromeric arrays and WGS.

The file is tab delimited (including a #header). Columns 1 to 6 
provide data for the masked copy: chromosome accession, chromosome 
name, span start, span stop, scaffold accession, and scaffold or 
region name. Columns 7 to 12 provide the same data for the unmasked
cognate. Coordinates are 1-based. n.a. - not applicable.

col 1:  masked_copy_chr_accn
col 2:  masked_copy_chr_name
col 3:  masked_copy_start
col 4:  masked_copy_stop
col 5:  masked_scaf_accn
col 6:  masked_scaf_or_region_name
col 7:  unmasked_cognate_chr_accn
col 8:  unmasked_cognate_chr_name
col 9:  unmasked_cognate_start
col 10: unmasked_cognate_stop
col 11: unmasked_scaf_accn
col 12: unmasked_scaf_or_region_name


6. Definitions
==============

Unlocalized sequence:
A sequence found in an assembly that is associated with a specific 
chromosome but cannot be ordered or oriented on that chromosome. 

Unplaced sequence:
A sequence found in an assembly that is not associated with any 
chromosome.  

Alt-scaffold:
A scaffold that provides an alternate representation of a locus found
in the primary assembly. These sequences do not represent a complete
chromosome sequence although there is no hard limit on the size of the
alternate locus; currently these are less than 1 Mb.

Major release:
The formal release of a genome assembly, e.g. GRCh38.

Minor release:
A release of a genome assembly including patches that occurs between
major releases.

Genome Patch:
A sequence contig/scaffold that corrects sequence in a major release
of the genome, or adds sequence to it.

Fix-patch:
A patch that corrects sequence or reduces an assembly gap in a given
major release. FIX patch sequences are meant to be incorporated into
the primary or existing alt-loci assembly units at the next major
release.

Novel-patch:
A patch that adds sequence to a major release. Typically, NOVEL patch
sequences are meant to be incorporated into the assembly as new
alternate loci at the next major release.

Decoy:
A sequence that is not part of the genome assembly but is included in
an analysis set as a sink for alignment of reads that are often
present in sequencing samples.
