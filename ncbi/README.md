# NCBI: Submitting high-throughput sequence data to GEO

## Submission instructions

GEO accepts next generation sequence data that examine quantitative gene
expression, gene regulation, epigenomics or other aspects of functional genomics
using methods such as RNA-seq (including single-cell), miRNA-seq, ChIP-seq,
RIP-seq, HiC-seq, methyl-seq, etc. We process all components of your study,
including the samples, project description, processed data files, and we submit
the raw data files to the [Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/)
on your behalf.

Steps: 

1. [Check that GEO accepts your data type.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/seq.html#categories)
2. [Gather raw files.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/seq.html#raw)
3. [Gather processed data files.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/seq.html#processed)
