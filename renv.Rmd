# Bioconductor and Virtual Environments

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute
code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

## `renv`

To use `renv` with Bioconductor packages, initialize a {renv} project:

```{r init, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
renv::init(bioconductor = TRUE)
```

## Libraries 

Install missing libraries with `renv::install()` or `install.packages()`. Here,
we'll use `renv::install()` since it is already initialized and configured to
use Bioconductor (` BiocManager::install()`)

```{r}
library(renv)
renv::install("DESeq2")
library(DESeq2)
```

Check the status and options of renv with:

```{r}
renv::status()
```

### Download binaries, not source

To avoid having to compile source code, tell R to download binaries:

```{r}
options(pkgType = "binary")
```

Now, installations should be significantly faster.
